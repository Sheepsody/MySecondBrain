## Why use a Decentralized Search Engine ? {#why-use-a-decentralized-search-engine}

-   Access to searchable databases, that cannot be crawled
-   Privacy &amp; Access control
-   Related to _Fererated Search_


## For whom ? {#for-whom}

-   Individuals (Peer-to-peer search)
-   Specialists (Vertical Search)


## Types of architectures {#types-of-architectures}


### Peer-to-peer networks {#peer-to-peer-networks}

-   Indexes located alongside the resources
-   Queries are distributed and merged back by the issuer


### Broker-based architecture {#broker-based-architecture}

-   Indexes located alongside the resources
-   Queries are forwarded to resources, and results are merged by a broker


### Crawling &amp; Metadata harvesting {#crawling-and-metadata-harvesting}


## Broker-based DIR {#broker-based-dir}


### Steps {#steps}

1.  Resource description
    -   _Cooperative Environment_
        -   [STARTS (Stanford Protocol Proposal for Internet and RetrievalSearch)](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/283/)
    -   _Uncooperative environment_ (the data is not shared, only the result of queries)
        -   Ex: learned Query-based sampling
2.  Resource selection
3.  Resource merging
