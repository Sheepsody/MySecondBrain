## Why use a Decentralized Search Engine ? {#why-use-a-decentralized-search-engine}

- Access to searchable databases, that cannot be crawled
- Privacy & Access control
- Related to _Fererated Search_

## For whom ? {#for-whom}

- Individuals (Peer-to-peer search)
- Specialists (Vertical Search)

## Types of architectures {#types-of-architectures}

### Peer-to-peer networks {#peer-to-peer-networks}

- Indexes located alongside the resources
- Queries are distributed and merged back by the issuer

### Broker-based architecture {#broker-based-architecture}

- Indexes located alongside the resources
- Queries are forwarded to resources, and results are merged by a broker

### Crawling & Metadata harvesting {#crawling-and-metadata-harvesting}

## Broker-based DIR {#broker-based-dir}

### Steps {#steps}

1.  Resource description
    - _Cooperative Environment_
      - [STARTS (Stanford Protocol Proposal for Internet and RetrievalSearch)](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/283/)
    - _Uncooperative environment_ (the data is not shared, only the result of queries)
      - Ex: learned Query-based sampling
2.  Resource selection
3.  Resource merging
