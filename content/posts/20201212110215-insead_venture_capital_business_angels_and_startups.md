## Introduction {#introduction}

### Henning Piezunka {#henning-piezunka}

- Teacher at INSAED
- Funder of a web-design company that sold in 2016

### How to use the course ? {#how-to-use-the-course}

- Types of learning
  - _Stealing_: deploy what you have learned
  - _Inspiration_: trigger an idea you can use
  - _Oyster_: the knowledge can become handy later
  - _Discomfort_: something that disturbs you

### Example of the course {#example-of-the-course}

[A16Z](https://a16z.com/) A renown VC

## Primer in Venture Capital {#primer-in-venture-capital}

- Georges Doriot (_the first VC_)
  - He was a teacher at Harvard
  - Returning GIs would become entrepreneurs
- _"The best way to predict the future us to make it. The second best way is to finance it"_, John Doerr

- 63% of total market capitalization, 85% of R&D

- _"Entrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity beyond resources controlled"_, Howard Stevenson

### Why <span class="underline">can</span> ventures benefit from VC ? {#why-ventures-benefit-from-vc}

- Money
- Advice, mentoring
- Governance
- Status, reputation (stamp of approval)
- Social defense (lawyers, etc.)

- Competitiveness (ex of Uber vs Lyft)

### Money Flow {#money-flow}

- _Limiter parters_ (university endowment, investors, etc.) (as long as you put a few hundred millions, unless rolling funds)
- 98% goes in the VC (the rest un management)
- Entrepreneurs/Venture
- Liquidity event

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/vc_circle.png" caption="Figure 1: The money flow circle" width="600px" >}}

### Liquidity {#liquidity}

- 90% of exists are now done with M&A (reversed compared to 90s)
- If they go to IPO, it takes 4 years (~12 years in total) than the 90s
- More and more money available in private markets

- When the company stays private, **it is a more exclusive game**, which creates inequalities in the society

- Returns on investment are _largely skewed_

- PE vs VC
  - VC: building a new company
  - PE: increase value of an existing company

### VC: agglomerators vs. specialists {#vc-agglomerators-vs-dot-specialists}

### How does VCs work depending on countries ? {#how-does-vcs-work-depending-on-countries}

- European large firms don't buy startups at the rate the US firms do

### The process is the same as _dating_ {#the-process-is-the-same-as-dating}

1.  Attracting
2.  Selecting
3.  Writing a prenup
4.  Being happily married

## Access {#access}

- **Access** explains the most variation in VCs success

- _Spend less time trying to be a good picker, and more time trying to be worth being picked_, Michael McCormick

### Attracting high potential individuals {#attracting-high-potential-individuals}

#### _Fishing_ : prior success helps being more successful {#fishing-prior-success-helps-being-more-successful}

- Importance of communication (a16z does 200 tweets/day)
- But we need attention from the _right peoples_
- Have a strong expertise and advertise it (Ex: [A16Z Blog on ML/AI](https://a16z.com/category/machine-learning/))
- Have a clear and appealing message
- A16Z actively communicates to <span class="underline">founder CEOs</span> (that are usually replaced)

#### _Hunting_ : head-hunt people from their personal networks {#hunting-head-hunt-people-from-their-personal-networks}

- Interacting with universities
  - Ex: Stanford teacher with Google
- Act as judges in idea competitions
- Entrepreneurs might not be looking for investors

### Rejections {#rejections}

- 99.9% of the applications are refused (A16Z)
- _Convince people to be entrepreneurs_
- Founders under-estimate how much time fundrasing takes
  - Do it loooooooooong before you need it

### Organization {#organization}

- Clear internal responsibilities on fund-raising
- _"The best way to get help is to get yourself to a place where you don't need help"_
- Have _traction_ in your operational business

## Screening {#screening}

### Exercise {#exercise}

#### Subject: judge whether the deal made by a VC was any good {#subject-judge-whether-the-deal-made-by-a-vc-was-any-good}

- Real venture, but disguised
- Imagine you would invest in this venture in 2013, and we have the answer in 2020
- [Subject (INSEAD website)](https://insead.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV%5F3OahIKYXqce0Vjn)

### The network {#the-network}

- VCs tend to work with ventures where they already know the founder or an employee
  - Question of _trust_
  - But, with a broader view, the network is mainly _"white Caucasian"_
- How to evaluate a venture ?
  - Question of FP (Type 1) and NP (Type 2)
    - _"Investors are pinched between two kinds of fear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, ,and fear of missing out on startups that take off"_, Paul Graham
    - **Goal** : _You don't manage risk, you want to find companies that pay for the rest_
    - Different to insurances

### Contrarian {#contrarian}

- Being a Contrarian
  - You need to be _accurate and different_
  - **The Contrarian question**: write something you believe to be true, that most people believe is false
  - The _difference has to become a feature_
- How can you fail to create something Contrarian ?
  1.  You're not alone
  2.  It is not true

### The 7 domain framework {#the-7-domain-framework}

- Classic evaluation fail short....

- General domains
  1.  **Value proposition:**
      - What is the churn rate ?
      - What is the revenue per user ?
  2.  **Market feasibility**
      - Trends that affect the global market
      - Attractiveness
  3.  **Industry domain**
      - What trends affect the global market ?
      - Regulatory environment ?
  4.  **Resources**
      - **VRIN** _(Valuable, Rare, Immutable and Non-substitutable advantage)_
- Team domains
  1.  **Goals and aspiration** of the founders
  2.  **Skills**
  3.  **Network**
