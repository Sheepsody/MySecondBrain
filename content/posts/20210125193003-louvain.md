## Modularity Optimization {#modularity-optimization}


### What ? {#what}

-   **Community detection**
    -   Finding sets of nodes with dense internal connections, and sparser connections between them (i.e. externally)

-   Computationally intensive
    -   The exact solution is often intractable, especially in large networks
    -   Wide variety of approximate methods


### Why ? {#why}

-   Useful in the study of community networks (like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc...)
    -   _Ex:_ Granovetter's study on job search ([Granovetter, n.d.](#orgd7d3fc0)), studied in Mines ParisTech's _Market Sociology_ course
    -   Two important observations about the network's structure
        1.  Structurally embedded edges (strong ties) are socially stronger ;
        2.  Weaker ties (long range edges) are informationally stronger, and are those yielding most opportunities ;
    -   Weaker ties enable us to get new opportunities, which raises the importance of _"pivotal"_ peoples


## Methods {#methods}


### Hierarchical clustering : Girvan-Newman algorithm {#hierarchical-clustering-girvan-newman-algorithm}

-   In **hierarchical clustering**, one defines a similarity measure quantifying some similarity between pairs
    -   Either _divisive_ of _additive_ approaches

-   **Girvan-Newman algorithm** ([Girvan and Newman 2002](#orgcdc79a0))
    -   Edges are progressively removed using a **centrality criteria**
    -   \\(O(m^{2} n)\\) runtime, for n vertices and m edges (impractical for large networks)
    -   The _"edge-betweenness"_ is proportional to the number of shortest paths connecting all pairs of nodes that cross the respective link
    -   The output of this algorithm is a **dendrogram**

-   Steps of the algorithm
    1.  Calculate the betweenness of all existing edges
    2.  Remove the edge(s) with the highest betweenness
    3.  Recompute the betweenness for affected nodes
    4.  Loop until no edge remain !


### Modularity optimization : Louvain {#modularity-optimization-louvain}

-   **Modularity** is the function that measures the quality of a particular division of a network
    -   Goal: find the best divisions of a network into communities
    -   The exact solutions is intractable, so approximate methods such as _greedy-algorithms_ are used
    -   \\(Q(G)=\frac{1}{2m} \sum\_{i,j} (A\_{ij} - \frac{k\_{i}k\_{j}}{2m}) \delta(c\_{i}, c\_{j})\\), where
        -   \\(k\_{i}\frac{k\_{j}}{2m}\\) is the expected number of edges between i and j
        -   \\(A\_{ij}\\) edge weight between the nodes
        -   \\(2m\\) is the sum of all the edges
        -   \\(\delta(c\_{i},c\_{j})\\) indicates whether the nodes are in the same community

-   **Louvain Algorithm** ([Blondel et al. 2008](#org7de2a0a))
    -   Greedy algorithm
    -   \\(O(n\log(n))\\) run time
    -   Most widely used, especially for the study of large networks

-   2 phases repeated **iteratively**
    1.  Modularity is **optimized** by allowing only local changes to node-community memberships
        -   Each node joins the neighbouring community that yields the highest modularity change
        -   Stop when no movements yield a gain
        -   \\(\Delta Q(i \rightarrow C) = [ \frac{\sum\_{in} + k\_{i, in}}{2m} - (\frac{\sum\_{tot} + k\_{i}}{2m})^{2} ] - [ \frac{\sum\_{in}}{2m} - (\frac{\sum\_{tot}}{2m})^{2} - (\frac{k\_{i}}{2m})^{2}]\\), where \\(k\_{tot}\\) represents all the links of nodes in C, and \\(k\_{in}\\) the links between
    2.  The identified communities are **aggregated** into super-nodes to build a new network
        -   The weight is the sum from their corresponding communities

### Statistical Inference : BigCLAM {#statistical-inference-bigclam}

-   **Statistical inference** ([Yang and Leskovec, n.d.](#org31e323e))
    -   Fit a **generative** model to the network data, which encodes the community structure
    -   Directly addresses statistical significance
    -   Inherently addresses the issue of statistical significance

-   Two steps
    1.  Define a **GAM _(Community Affiliation Graph Model)_** for graphs based on community affiliations
    2.  Find the best AGM that could have generated the graph, and discover the communities using it

-   Theoretical framework
    -   How to generate community affiliations ?
        -   \\(p(u,v) = 1 - \sum\_{c \in M\_{u} \cap M\_{v}} (1-p\_{c})\\)
        -   Probability of finding a link between i and j, that have multiple memberships \\(M\_{k}\\)
    -   How to estimate model parameters \\(F\\) given a graph ?
        -   Maximum likelihood estimation : \\(argmax\_{F} P(G | F)\\)
    -   We can **relax** the memberships, with \\(F\_{u}\\) being a vector of community memberships for node u...

-   **BigCLAM Model**
    -   \\(P(u,v) = 1 - exp(-F\_{u} \cdot F\_{v}^{T} )\\) (the probability of linking is proportional to memberships strength)
    -   Log-likelihood of network :  \\(L(F) = \sum\_{(u,v) \in E} log(1-exp(-F\_{u} \cdot F\_{v}^{T})) - \sum\_{(u,v) \notin E} F\_{u}F\_{v}^{T}\\)
    -   Optimize using gradient descent \\(\Delta l(F\_{u}) = \sum \_{v \in N} F\_{v} \frac{exp(-F\_{u} \cdot F\_{v}^{T})}{1 - exp(-F\_{u} \cdot F\_{v}^{T})} - \sum\_{v \notin N} F\_{v}\\)
