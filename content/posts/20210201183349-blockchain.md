## Blockchain Introduction {#blockchain-introduction}

### General Introduction {#general-introduction}

#### BitCoin & BlockChain innovation {#bitcoin-and-blockchain-innovation}

- BitCoin is both

  - The name of the network/protocol
  - The digital asset it exchanges

- The network
  - Validates all the transactions that are broadcasted every 10 minutes
  - Keeps a database of past transactions for validation

#### Definitions & Key terms of the Blockchain Economy {#definitions-and-key-terms-of-the-blockchain-economy}

- **Blockchain network**

  - global computer created by multiple, distributed and decentralized computer systems, each running the same software and working in consensus to validate transactions and to keep identical copies of the ledger

- **(Distributed) Ledger**

  - database shared on the network where all the transactions are recorded

- **Blockchain**

  - ledger that is organized in blocks. New information is added to the existing database by adding new blocks to its end, in a timely manner.

- **Mining**

  - act of creating valid (Bitcoin) blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are the computers (or devices) that mine
  - Pool of miners that work together and share the rewards

- **Block subsidy**

  - reward (paid in bitcoins) that a miner receive when it is the first to validate a block. It corresponds to the new creation of money generated automatically by the block
  - hard maximum of 21 million

- **Transaction**
  - buying, selling or transferring of digital assets

### History {#history}

#### Cryptocurrencies timeline: a history of digital money {#cryptocurrencies-timeline-a-history-of-digital-money}

{{< figure src="images/bitcoin_history.png" caption="Figure 1: BitCoin history" >}}

- The **silk road**
  - Online black market and the first modern darknet market
  - Tor hidden service
  - October 2013 : FBI shuts down the service and arrests Ross Ulbricht
    - sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.

#### The crypto capitalization {#the-crypto-capitalization}

- [Jan. 2021] \$1 Trillion

### Functioning & Key Principles {#functioning-and-key-principles}

#### Transaction in a blockchain {#transaction-in-a-blockchain}

- **Public key cryptography**

  - 1970, by Martin Hellman, Whitfield Diffie, and Ralph Merkle
  - Use functions that are easy to calculate, but hard to inverse
    - _Ex:_ prime-factorization
  - **Elliptic curve cryptography**
  - The **private key** generation (creating a random number) is done offline
  - The **public key** is obtained using \\(K=k\*G\\) (where \\(G\\) is the _generator point_, and \\(\*\\) the _elliptic curve multiplication_)
    - The reverse operation (_discrete logarithm_) is as difficult as trying all possibilities
    - This produces a point on the elliptic curve
  - BitCoin & Ethereum use **secp256k1**
    - OpenSSL provides such an implementation
    - libsecp256k1 is the BitCoin Core's implementation, considered superior

- **Cryptographic hash functions**

  - Map data of arbitrary size to a fixed one
  - Five properties : determinism, verifiability, non-correlation, collision-prediction & irreversibility
  - BitCoin: SHA-256
  - Ethereum: Keccak256
  - Produces the **addresses**
  - Ethereum uses ICAP (Inter-exchange Client Address Protocol) & EIP-55 for Hex-encoding with checksum in capitalization

- Two algorithms for **digital signature** (mathematical scheme for presenting the authenticity of digital messages or documents)
  - Using the **ECDSA** algorithm (_elliptic curve digital signature algorithm_)
    - \\(y^{2} = x^{3} + 7 \pmod{p}\\)
      - \\(b=2^{256} - 2^{32} - 2^{9} - 2^{8} - 2^{7} - 2^{6} - 2^{4} -1\\)
      - _curve-generator point_ G
    - In this space, \\(P+Q\\) is still in on the elliptic curve
  - **Signature generation** (**offline**), to create a _digital fingerprint_ using the _private key_
    - \\(s \equiv key\_{private}^{-1} ( hash(m) + key\_{private} \* r )\\)
      - \\(key\_{private}^{-1}\\) is the _modular multiplicative index_
      - \\(r\\) is the x-coordinate of the public key
      - r and s are sent alongside the message
  - **Signature verification**, to verify the signature using the private key
    - \\(w = s^{-1} \pmod{p}\\), \\(u\_{1} = hash(m) \* w \pmod{p}\\) et \\(u\_{2} = r \* w \pmod{p}\\)
    - \\(Q \equiv s^{-1} \* hash(m) \* G + s^{-1} \* r \* K\\)
    - \\(Q\_{x}\\) should be equal to \\(r\\)

#### Proof-of-work concensus {#proof-of-work-concensus}

{{< figure src="images/bitcoin_block.png" caption="Figure 2: Block structure" >}}

- How to decide which block will be pushed to the chain?
  - A **nonce** must be added at the end of the block's en-tÃªte
    - The hash of the block must for instance start by 0000
    - Miners compete together to solve this "hash"
  - The verified block is **broadcasted**
  - If approved, it included in the blockchain and shared with the network

{{< figure src="images/bitcoin_process.png" caption="Figure 3: Blockchain process" >}}

### BlockChain overview & applications {#blockchain-overview-and-applications}

#### BitCoin vs Ethereum {#bitcoin-vs-ethereum}

- **Ethereum** (2013, Vitalik Buterin)
  - Turing-complete protocol to exchange any value
  - Fuels the execution of **DApps** encapsulated in smart contracts

#### Applications {#applications}

<!--list-separator-->

- Digital identity

  - ID2020 : use blockchain to record people's identity

    - Registered users can control their personal data to share access and appropriate information

  - Everledger : provide secured proof of origin and ethical sourcing for diamonds

<!--list-separator-->

- Digital assets

  - **Digital assets** can be

    - Cryptocurrencies (like BitCoin)
    - Utility Tokens : access to an infrastructure or service
      - _Ex:_ **ICO** _(Initial Coin Offering)_
    - Digital Securities : security tokens represent a conversion of rights of an asset on the blockchain
      - Why ?
        - Paperless, Instant clearing and settlement, programmability, auditability, etc.

  - **CDBC** _(Central Bank Digital Currencies)_ case study
    - Digital currency issued by a central bank
    - Centrally controlled cryptocurrency that stores value

### The different kinds of Blockchains {#the-different-kinds-of-blockchains}

#### Private, Public & Consortium blockchains {#private-public-and-consortium-blockchains}

| Blockchain | Bitcoin | Ripple              | Ethereum | Hyperledger-based |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Nature     | Public  | Private             | Public   | Private           |
| Token ?    | BTC     | XRP                 | ETH      | No token          |
| Consensus  | PoW     | PBFT with node list | PoW      | PBFT              |

- Public blockchains require a token (or cryptocurrency) function

  - Miners need an incentive to contribute to the network

- **PBFT** (_Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance_) consensus algorithm

  - 2/3 of the nodes have to agree for a message to be accepted

- **Ripple** (private blockchain for bank exchanges)

  - In December 2020, Ripple Labs and two of its executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for selling XRP tokens, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities
  - Jan 2020: Pump up from thousands of individuals to inflate the markets

- **Consortium Blockchains**
  - The consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes
  - The read access can be also restricted

#### How blockchains are managed {#how-blockchains-are-managed}

- BIP (_BitCoin improvement Proposal_)

  - Community of developers can suggest improvements
  - [List of BIPs submitted so far](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/README.mediawiki)

- Different modifications

  - **Forks** have a shared history (the record of transactions stays the same)
  - **Hard fork** : eliminates existing rules
    - New blocks are accepted, and will be rejected by nodes that accept the old rules
  - **Soft fork** : lightens or adds new rules
    - Old nodes will continue to accept new blocks since validations checks still pass
  - _Ex:_ BitCoin classic, XC, etc.

- Ethereum Classic (ETC)
  - Unaltered version of the Ethereum network
  - Flaw in the DAO (_Decentralized Autonomous Organization_), which provided a form of investor directed VC
  - Recursive Call flaw

### Sharding & Zilliqa {#sharding-and-zilliqa}

- _Issue:_ number of transactions per second (tps) for common blockchain

  - BitCoin : 7 tps
  - Ethereum : 15 tps
  - _But_ Zilliqa : 2500 tps !

- Zilliqa's **sharding** provides linear scaling as the blockchain grows in size ([Team 2017](#org5cc36bf))

  - Divide the mining nodes on the network in groups of 600 nodes (_shard_)
  - _Divide and conquer in parallel_

- [**Network Sharding**](https://blog.zilliqa.com/https-blog-zilliqa-com-the-zilliqa-design-story-piece-by-piece-part1-d9cb32ea1e65) has to solve 3 issues :

  1.  Sybil resistance
      - An intensive PoW is required to join the network
      - Hard to spawn multiple nodes
  2.  Shard creation
      - _DS (Directory Service) committee_
      - Nodes elected based on a PoW
      - Validates other nodes PoW and assigns them to a shard
  3.  Shard size
      - With shards of size 600, there is a \\(10^{-6}\\) chance that 1/3 of nodes are malicious if they represent 1/4 of the network

- [**Consensus Protocol**](https://blog.zilliqa.com/the-zilliqa-design-story-piece-by-piece-part-2-consensus-protocol-e38f6bf566e3)
  - _Note:_ reusing Nakamoto's consensus would not yield a more efficient protocol (PoW)
  - **PBFT** _(Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)_ ([Castro and Liskov 1999](#org1b40094))
    - Assumption: 1/3 of the nodes are malicious
  - Benefits : transaction finality, energy efficiency & lower payout variance
  - Zilliqa uses _multi-signature cryptography_ instead of MAC to speed up the original pBFT algorithm

## Cryptography on the Blockchain {#cryptography-on-the-blockchain}

### Definitions {#definitions}

#### Definitions {#definitions}

- (Technical) definition of a blockchain

  - Distributed system
  - Public write-only database
  - High latency, small bandwidth

- History

  - Cryptographic timestamps (1980)
  - Cryptographic coins (1980)
  - Anonymous decentralization (2000+)

- Proprieties of a Blockchain

  - Immutability
  - Security
  - Safety
  - Auditability
  - Automation
  - Cost
    - _Inconvenient_ (Fork, latency, bandwidth, etc.)

- **Distributed system** : collection of independent computers that appears as one seamless computer
  - Choose _two of three_ (**CAP theorem**) ([Gilbert and Lynch 2002](#org85ab92a))
    1.  **Consistency** : identical data on the nodes
    2.  **Availability** in case of nodes failure
    3.  **Partition tolerance** in case of network failure

#### Cryptography {#cryptography}

- Hash function

  - Properties
    1.  Fixed size output from any input
    2.  Hard to invert function
    3.  Hard to find collisions
  - 17 August 2004, _Lightning talk at Crypto '04_
    - Some chinese scientists find collisions in MD4, MD5, etc...
    - ... with paper and pencil !
  - Competition to find hash functions
    - [Keccak Team](https://keccak.team/index.html)

- Aggregation with Merkle trees ([Merkle 1988](#orgccc862a))

  - In BitCoin, each transaction is hashed, then each pair of transactions is concatenated and hashed together, and so on until there is one hash for the entire block
  - Tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes
  - Allows for efficient and secure verification of large data-structures
  - Merkle proof : no need to download the whole tree to verify a transaction
  - Ethereum uses Merkle Patricia Tree for turing-completeness

- Public key systems
  - **RSA** : relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers _("factoring problem")_
  - **Elliptic curve cryptography** : relies on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields

#### BlockChain {#blockchain}

- Transactions types

  1.  **P2PK** : Pay to public key
  2.  **P2PKH** : Pay to Public Key Hash
  3.  **P2SH** : Pay to Script Hash
  4.  **P2MS** : Pay to Multi Signature

- **P2PKH Algorithm**

  - _Transaction_ : \\(T\_{j} = \\{ K\_{A}, i, m, w\_{B} \\}\\)
  - _Output_ : payment flow from \\(m\\) to \\(w\_{B}\\)
  - _Input_ : funds \\(T\_{I} = (..., m\prime, w\_{A})\\)
  - _Signature_ : with \\(k\_{A}\\) (private key) : \\(s\_{A}(T\_{j}) = E(k\_{A}, h(T\_{j}))\\)
  - _Verifications_ : computed by the miner
    - Source verification
    - Enough funds
    - Not spend between the blocks
    - Valid signature \\(D(K\_{A}, s\_{A}(T\_{j})) = h(T\_{j})\\)

- _Proof of work_ : **Partial Hash Inversion**
  - **Security** : 50% of resources are needed to control the chain
  - **Repartition** : random between miners
  - **Creation** : 6.25 BTC/bloc (about 10 minutes), 10M per year
  - **Evolution** : 3.12 BTC/bloc

### Issues {#issues}

  - Rights (to be forget)
  - Sensible data
  - Malware

## Smart Contracts {#smart-contracts}

### Introduction {#introduction}

#### History of smart contracts {#history-of-smart-contracts}

- Nick Szabo (1994)

  - Analogy of a vending machine, which creates an implicit contract with the user
  - Ethereum (2015) : full-fledge smart-contract platform

- A smart contract is a simple account (address + balance) with **external space** to hold code and storage

  - **Publicly** visible
  - Not really contracts neither smart (simple code)

- A blockchain is a form of _finite state machine_
  - Any transaction can modify the registry
  - A finite state machine can solve any computational problem

#### Steps of a smart contract {#steps-of-a-smart-contract}

1.  **Origination** (creation of the contract)
    - Code and initial storage
    - Computation and space must be paid for
2.  **Call** of a smart contract
    - Tokens and parameters are sent
    - Parameters are sent as input, and computations must be paid for
    - Atomic execution

#### Writing smart contracts {#writing-smart-contracts}

- Scripts are written in **bytecode**

  - Every node in the VM shares this code
  - Usually a **virtual stack machine**
  - _Ex:_ EVM, Tezos, etc.

- Different kinds of high level languages

  - Solidity, Vyper, etc...
  - WASM like VMs : Rust, C, etc.

- Stack-based language

  - Every instruction rewrites an input stack to an output stack
  - Static typing
  - Specific instructions and data (tokens, addresses, cryptographic operations, etc.)

- Low-level features for easier gas accounting
  - Only error triggered by formal verification can invalidate the operations, user doesn't have the tokens or not enough gas

#### Computing and storage costs {#computing-and-storage-costs}

- What if ?

  - The execution does not terminate
  - The code stores a massive amount of data
  - _The user must pay_, to avoid **DOS** (Denial-Of-Service) attacks

- **gas** : execution of smart contract

  - Per-block and per-operation limits
  - User declares the quantity of gas the operation will consume
  - Operation fails if declared < gas

- **fee** : sender attach them to the transactions

  - Baker can decide which operation to process to maximize their fees
  - Fees are kept by baker if transaction fails from gas exhaustion
  - No link with gas

- **burn** : storage costs
  - Storage is paid by **burning tokens**, proportional to the number of bytes
  - When calling, only additional storage is paid (_High-Water-Mark_)

### Programming on the EVM with Solidity {#programming-on-the-evm-with-solidity}

- Ethereum is _almost_ turing-complete

  - gas consumption restricts the turing-completeness

- Decentralized applications

  - Smart contract + web interface (optionality p2p storage and messaging)
  - Web3 : empower the web with its original purpose
  - Web3.js, Whisper & Qwarm librairies

- **Solidity and EVM** _(Ethereum Virtual Machine)_
  - The EVM executes **compiled** code **deterministically**
  - _solc_ compiler
  - ERC 20: specifies a standard for digital tokens
  - The [truffle suite](https://github.com/trufflesuite) is the most common dev suite for solidity

## DeFi : Decentralized Finance {#defi-decentralized-finance}

### Concept {#concept}

- **DeFi _(Decentralized Finance)_** is a form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries
  - Applications in lending, exchange, derivatives, asset management, etc.
  - Use smart contracts on block-chains to manage digital assets

### Protocol examples {#protocol-examples}

#### AAVE {#aave}

- [**AAVE**](https://github.com/aave) : **automated lending protocol** (ghost in finish)
  - Most popular lending protocol, with \$3B of TVL (Total Value Lended)
  - ICO : \$16M raised in 2018
  - _Peer-to-contract_, where used directly interact with pool funds
    - Eliminates time necessary to find a counterparty
  - Two kinds of users : depositors and borrowers
  - 1:1 ratio for A-tokens (amount + interests) (ERC20)
  - Accredited by FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) in the US

#### Uniswap {#uniswap}

  - 4th largest cryptocurrency exchange (100\$ billions traded over 8 months)
  - A set Ethereum smart contracts that build upon the concepts of liquidity and automated market making
  - Automated liquidity protocol for ERC20 tokens

- [Uniswap v2](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2)
  - Based on a principle of [**pools**](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/core-concepts/pools/)
  - _Algorithmic agents_ supply the assets to make the market
    - The goal for those agents is to provide liquidity and capture the pool's fees
  - Gain liquidity token (LP) based on the provided liquidity
    - _Constant Product Market Maker Model_ : \\(x\*y=k\\)
    - The fee is distributed proportionality to the LP held

#### Synthetix {#synthetix}

- **Synthetix** is a derivative protocol
