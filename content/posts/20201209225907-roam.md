## What is it ? {#what-is-it}

ROAM is a hierarchical note-taking app, that builds upon the _ZettleKasten_ ("slip-box") method, used by prominent scientists such as Niklas Luhmann. The fundamental insight is that by building a web of thoughts, one can better connect ideas, and make more reliable decision. Org-Roam, is a replica of this method for Org Mode, that keeps its basic functionalities.

Building such a Directed Graph of knowledge, allows us to free ourselves from the classic "file-tree" and limitations. In fact, storing files at unit of data considerably limits our memory retrieval capacities, and leads to cognitive biases, unreliable assumption, etc.

On the opposite, the "slip-box" method works similarly to that of the brain, where each neurons might occupy different positions in thought sequences. By representing our notes in this manner, we can use Bayesian reasoning to estimate and test hypothesis, which considerably improves the way we make decisions. Some articles also suggest this kind of reasoning empowers creativity.
